## ✅ Features

- Basic arithmetic: `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `mod`, `pow`
- Advanced operations: `sqrt`, `factorial`, `gcd`, `lcm`, `is_prime`, `fibonacci`
- Statistics: `average`, `median`, `mode`, `variance`, `standard_deviation`
- Combinatorics: `permutation`, `combination`
- Logarithmic functions: `logarithm`

## 🧪 Testing

Tests are written using **pytest** in the `tests/test_operations.py` file. Run them locally with:

pytest

## ⚙️ Continuous Integration
GitHub Actions is used for CI. Every push or pull request to the main branch triggers:
 

1.Dependency installation

2.Test execution via pytest

## 📦 Installation
Install the required dependencies using:


pip install -r requirements.txt
